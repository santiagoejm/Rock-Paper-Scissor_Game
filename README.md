# Rock Paper Scissor Game

Hello World!! This project, is the _Classical Rock, Paper, Scissor Game_. We all know the rules of it, however I took the liberty to change the already known symbols of the choices (_rock, paper, scissor_), and instead used the symbols of _diamond, toilet paper and garden shear_, just to change the routine. It's functionality is developed with plain **Vanilla JavaScript**, using _arrow functions_ to control its functionality.

The _Styling_ was developed with **CSS**, and it's developed, thinking in the old school archaic games, but with a renewed theme.

## Current Functionality

- Once the user, "_Clicked_" on the `button` of their move, the name of the same will be displayed at the same time that the randomized _computers choice_.
- Both moves, will be compared according to the games rules, and a veredict will be dictated. Either You Win!! You Lose!! It's a Draw!!.
- The Score will be updated, obtaining +1 point for the winner, and 0 points for the loser. In case of draw, neither receive points.

## Future Functionality to Implement

- Instead of displaying the name of the move realized by the user, an animation will take place. And the symbols will be included in the `div` for this purpose.
